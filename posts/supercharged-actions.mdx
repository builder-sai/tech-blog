## Create summaries ##

Simply output Markdown content to a new environment variable we’ve introduced called $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY. Any Markdown content added to this file will then be displayed on the Actions run summary page. That’s it!
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Adding markdown
    run: echo '### Hello world! :rocket:' >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```
