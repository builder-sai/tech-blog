## Secure cloud deployment ##

OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows your GitHub Actions workflows to access resources in your cloud provider, without having to store any credentials as long-lived GitHub secrets.

To use OIDC, you will first need to configure your cloud provider to trust GitHub's OIDC as a federated identity, and must then update your workflows to authenticate using tokens.

```yaml
jobs:
  job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/github-script@v6
      id: script
      timeout-minutes: 10
      with:
        debug: true
        script: |
          const token = process.env['ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN']
          const runtimeUrl = process.env['ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL']
          core.setOutput('TOKEN', token.trim())
          core.setOutput('IDTOKENURL', runtimeUrl.trim())
```
